The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), 
played on the second Sunday in February since 2022, 
and it replaced the NFL Championship Game in 1966. 
Winning teams receive the Vince Lombardi Trophy, and the game was created as part 
of a 1966 merger agreement between the NFL and the American Football League (AFL). 
The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched sporting events globally, 
with expensive commercial airtime due to high viewership,
